# E- Commerce ver 1.0.0

Fully functional ecommerce website with user and guest checkout capabilities.

Early alpha project of an e-commerce project developed for a client of mine. 

Django x E-commerce website with payment integration and also the ability for users to shop as a guest or a registered user. Users are able to visit the site, shop around add items to carts without ever having to make an account. And then eventually at checkout, you would not need to register. Along with the ability for users to create an account and shop as registered user. 
The purpose of this project was learning to create a Django project and becoming familiar with core concepts and working with the back-end framework. Over the next few months I will keep adding to this project.
